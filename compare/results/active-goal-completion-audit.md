# Active Goal Completion Audit

Date: 2026-07-04

Active objective: keep working toward Alea's project mission until the goal is
actually achieved. In concrete terms for the current thread, this means driving
Alea's core RNG functionality and local Linux performance/validation roadmap to
no known core gaps against the locally available Rust `rand` / `rand_distr`
evidence, then raising the bar instead of declaring the product permanently
finished.

This audit is intentionally not a completion claim. It records the current
prompt-to-artifact checklist and the evidence that prevents calling the goal
complete.

## Prompt-to-Artifact Checklist

| Requirement | Evidence artifact / command | Current finding |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Core RNG functionality breadth must match or exceed local Rust evidence | `compare/results/distribution-parity-matrix.md`, `compare/results/linux-no-known-gaps-audit.md`, `docs/api-reference.md`, `zig build apicheck` | Functionality gaps are closed for the current Linux/local Rust surface. |
| Statistical validation must cover primary engines | PractRand reports under `compare/results/`, `compare/results/2026-06-28-practrand-128gib-summary.md`, `zig build statcheck` | Current 128GiB Linux stage is closed; portable fill smoke is recorded for `Xoshiro256PlusPlus`. |
| Reproducibility must be documented and checked beyond x86_64 Linux where possible | `compare/results/reproducibility-matrix.md`, `compare/results/2026-07-03-repro-wasm32-wasi-node.md`, `zig build crosscheck`, `zig build validate-all` | Current second-target WASI bar is closed; broader non-WASI runner gaps are tracked separately. |
| Benchmark parity must cover local Rust comparable rows | `compare/rand_bench/src/main.rs`, `bench/throughput.zig`, `bench/vector.zig`, `compare/results/rust-benchmark-coverage-audit.md` | Current local Rust benchmark surface is mapped to Alea evidence. |
| S4-M1 broader platform reproducibility | `core-rand-coverage.md`, WASI report, `cross-platform-repro-blocker.md` | Closed for current bar. |
| S4-M2 longer statistical validation | 128GiB PractRand summary and engine reports | Closed for current bar. |
| S4-M3 SIMD/vector API design | `bench/vector.zig`, `simd-distribution-kernel-notes.md`, source audit in `core-rand-coverage.md` | Closed for API/prototype bar; performance blocker moved to S4-M4. |
| S4-M4 targeted performance follow-up | `compare/results/performance-triage.md`, `compare/results/s4-m4-remaining-gaps.md`, `lognormal-codegen-audit.md`, `simd-distribution-kernel-notes.md` | Not complete; LogNormal performance is covered by documented opt-ins/stable-default tradeoff, but dense SIMD blocker remains. |
| No proxy signal is accepted as whole-goal completion | `zig build validate-all` plus roadmap/audit files | Validation passes are necessary but not sufficient; blocker audits still show missing performance requirements. |

## Current Non-Completion Evidence

The active goal cannot be marked complete because `s4-m4-remaining-gaps.md`
now identifies one unresolved S4-M4 hard blocker:

1. Dense SIMD normal/exponential kernels have not beaten scalar ziggurat
   lane-fill in the real `vectorbench` slice-fill harness. The minimum
   real-harness benchmark gate is listed in `simd-distribution-kernel-notes.md`.

All other recently found S4-M4 side gaps have either been closed or narrowed by
checked-in evidence, including Hypergeometric H2PE coverage, static/dynamic
weighted samplers, f32 standard fills, OpenClosed f64 bulk, Cauchy, SkewNormal,
unit geometry direct rows, and many direct-source/bulk distribution workflows.
LogNormal exact defaults are now documented as a stable-output tradeoff with
multiple opt-in performance profiles (`BufferedLogNormal`, `LogNormalDlsymExp`,
`LogNormalLibmvec`, and f32 approximation/native variants) that cover the local
Rust performance gap without changing the exact default.

## Required Next Work Before Completion

The goal remains active until at least one of these happens:

- a dense SIMD normal/exponential candidate beats scalar lane-fill in the
  real vector-slice harness while preserving or explicitly versioning rejected
  lane stream shape;
- or the roadmap bar is deliberately raised/reshaped with explicit rationale and
  evidence that no current local Linux core RNG gap remains under the new bar.

Until then, do not call `update_goal(status=complete)`.
